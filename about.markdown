I am a [scientist][linkedin]. This blog is about my passion for data, [programming][apicco], and information technology. I like to share my learning endeavours in the hope of helping others. 

For any questions or feedback, please write to `write` `@` `myscitech.blog`.

Also, I am passionate about photography, of which you can find some examples in my online portfolio [myfisheye.pictures][photo].
