excerpt: "Yes, a computer drew this logo at my request."

[DALL-E2][dalle2] is a deep learning model developed by [OpenAI][openai]. 
You write in plain text what you want the computer to draw, and the machine outputs four images.
You can vary these images if you wish or enter a template. 
I used neither of these last options. I just asked [DALL-E2][dalle2] for an *Abstract one-line drawing representing a cute computer showing data.*

And that is what I got:
![The [myscitech.blog][myscitech] logo](/assets/images/myscitech-logo.png)

You can sign-up to [DALL-E2][dalle2], and you will get 50 free credits to generate as many requests. 
Once these credits are finished, you can purchase more (currently at 15$ for 115 credits) or wait one month for 15 free credits to be refilled.

Notably, [you own the images][dalle-copyright] you create with DALL.E, regardless of whether you generated them with free or paid credit. That's pretty cool!
